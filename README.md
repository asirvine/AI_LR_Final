# AI_LR_Final

The only thing that a player coming into this game needs to know is that the only grabbable items are the tennis balls and foam rollers. Other than this, the Locker room VR experience is fairly self explanatory within the parameters of a VR game. My writeup is below. 


Locker Room Individual Final Project
Andrew Irvine

For my final individual project, I recreated my team locker room in Virtual Reality. It is the most meaningful place for me on this campus, and somewhere that I care about having access to and would like to have preserved after I graduate and in case anything changes. Within the locker room, I have added a game where the player can get a foam roller and hit a tennis ball against the lockers, which is part of a game that we play as a team. This space and game are both things that will forever remind me of Vanderbilt and the friends that I have made here. 

Since I am a senior, I would really appreciate being able to access this locker room space when I move back to Chicago. It is the place I have spent the most time at throughout my years at Vanderbilt and my only place of continuity through my four years. It is also somewhere that I have not been able to show to my friends and family due to access limitations. Being able to do this will help them better understand my undergraduate experience and having access to the locker room in a controlled environment will be nice. Also, this past year, there was talk about removing half of the lockers and changing the layout of the room, so having this space preserved digitally is a major part of my goal for this project. My teammates also appreciate having this space preserved and being able to hit the tennis ball against the lockers in VR for as long as they would like. I sent them my demo video, and some responses included “I just wept. That was beautiful”, “if they ever remodel the LR they can never take it away” and “we’ve reached the future”. I was glad to see my teammates are as excited about this as I am. 

VR is a great medium to achieve my goals because it is so immersive. Seeing a picture of something brings back some memories of it, but actually being able to move around in the space is so much better than a picture. It is also a medium that is easily accessed and shared due to its digital nature. This makes it a great medium for me to remember the locker room, to show my friends and family the locker room, and to give access to the VR locker room to my teammates. 

This has been a very fun project to work on and having the opportunity to preserve this space and create this game has been very meaningful to me. It was also great to see my teammates so excited about it, and they will be accessing the VR experience in the coming weeks. I am so glad this space will be preserved forever.
